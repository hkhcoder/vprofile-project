   # Create a test directory with various images
   mkdir -p ~/demo-images
   # Download or copy test images (JPEG, PNG, different sizes)
   # Have at least:
   # - 1 normal image (< 1MB)
   # - 1 large image (> 5MB) to trigger warnings
   # - 1 corrupted/invalid image to test error handling
   ```

2. **Set Up Email**

## 🎬 Presentation Script

> "Now for the exciting part - let's trigger all 12 alarms one by one! I'll start with the simple ones. Watch what happens when I upload an HTML file disguised as a JPEG - the Lambda tries to process it, fails, and immediately logs an error. Within 60 seconds, the PIL errors alarm fires and I get an email notification.
>
> Next, I'll upload six large high-resolution images. These will trigger not just the 'large image' alarm, but also cause duration spikes and potentially trigger the duration alarm too.
>
> For the really interesting tests, I'll modify the infrastructure using Terraform - reducing the timeout to 5 seconds, then uploading a large image. Watch it timeout mid-processing! Same with memory - I'll drop it to 128MB and force an out-of-memory error.
>
> The beauty of Infrastructure as Code is I can make these changes, test the alarms, and restore everything back in minutes. Let's see it in action!"

---

## Part 11: Cleanup (2 minutes)

### 🎬 What to Show:

1. **Destroy Infrastructure**
   ```bash
   cd terraform
   terraform destroy
   ```
   
   **During Destroy**:
   - Type `yes` when prompted
   - Explain: "Terraform is removing all resources"
   - Show resources being deleted

2. **Verify Cleanup**
   - AWS Console → S3 → Show buckets deleted
   - CloudWatch → Dashboards → Show dashboard deleted
   - CloudWatch → Alarms → Show alarms deleted
   - Lambda → Functions → Show function deleted
   - SNS → Topics → Show topics deleted

3. **Final Note**
   ```bash
   # If any S3 buckets remain (due to versioning)
   aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name --force
   ```

### 📝 Script Template:
> "Cleanup is simple with Terraform. One command removes everything we created. In production, you'd keep these monitoring systems running, but for this demo, we'll clean up to avoid charges."
